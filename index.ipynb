    "2. An `LSTM()` layer (or `GRU()` layer, for the second model) of size `50`. During this step, also set the `return_sequences` parameter to `True`, so that during back propagation our models will calculate loss and learn for every step of the sequence, not just the final result of the sequence.\n",
    "3. A `GlobalMaxPool1D()` layer, so that our model performs a combined _MaxPool_  operation across all weights in the recurrent layer. \n",
    "4. A `Dropout()` layer set to `0.5`.\n",
    "5. A `Dense()` layer of size `50`, with this layer's `activation` parameter set to `'relu'`\n",
    "6. Another `Dropout()` layer set to `0.5`\n",
    "7. A `Dense()` layer that will act as our output layer. This layer should contain `20` neurons (one for each possible predicted class), and should have it's `activation` parameter set to `'softmax'`\n",
